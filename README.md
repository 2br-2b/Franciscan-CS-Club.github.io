This is the repository for Franciscan University's Computer Science Club!

As this is the internet, keep these details in mind:
- What goes on the internet stays on the internet. Anything that gets written here will remain forever!
- This is an official club website! Be sure to keep it (and this repo) at least semi-professional.
- Feel free to contribute! Even if you don't know html or javascript, you can still make issues like "I think we need to revise the first paragraph on our main page" or something like that to help contribute!
